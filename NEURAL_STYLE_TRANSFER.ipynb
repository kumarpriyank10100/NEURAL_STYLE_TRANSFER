        "### 🚀 Project 4: Neural Style Transfer (NST) in 5 Points\n",
        "\n",
        "* **1. The Objective:** The goal is to blend two distinct images—a **Content Image** (the structure) and a **Style Image** (the texture)—to create a new, AI-generated artwork that looks like a painting of the original photo.\n",
        "* **2. How the AI \"Sees\" Art:** The project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. It recognizes that deep layers of the brain capture **Shapes and Objects** (Content), while the shallow layers capture **Colors and Patterns** (Style).\n",
        "* **3. The Secret Math (Gram Matrix):** To capture \"Style,\" we don't just look at pixels; we use a **Gram Matrix**. This calculates how different features (like \"blue swirls\" and \"thick brushstrokes\") relate to each other across the image, defining the artist's unique \"fingerprint.\"\n",
        "* **4. Fast Style Transfer (Magenta):** Instead of the original 2015 method that took hours to \"optimize\" one image, this project uses a **Feed-forward Style Prediction Network**. This allows the AI to apply any artistic style to any photo in a single \"glance\" (inference pass), making it near-instant.\n",
        "* **5. Strategic Application (Transfer Learning):** By using a pre-trained model from **TensorFlow Hub**, we demonstrate **Transfer Learning**. We leverage a model that has already seen thousands of paintings, allowing us to generate professional-grade art without needing a supercomputer or a massive dataset.\n",
